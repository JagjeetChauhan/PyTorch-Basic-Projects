## üìÅ Projects

### 1. üé® CIFAR-10 Image Classification

**Description:**  
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely-used dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

**Features:**
- Custom CNN architecture
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy tracking and visualization

### 2.üå∏ Oxford 102 Flower Classification  
**Description:**  
This project implements a deep learning model using PyTorch to classify images from the Oxford 102 Flower dataset. The dataset consists of 8,189 images categorized into 102 flower classes with varying shapes, colors, and sizes, making it a challenging classification task.

**Features:**
- Data preprocessing and image augmentation
- Fine-tuning and model optimization
- Performance evaluation and accuracy visualization
