# üî• PyTorch Practice Projects

Welcome to my PyTorch practice projects repository!  
This repository contains a collection of basic deep learning projects built using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). Each project is designed to help reinforce core concepts of deep learning, improve coding skills, and serve as a foundation for more advanced work in the future.

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. üé® CIFAR-10 Image Classification

**Description:**  
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely-used dataset containing 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 different classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more.

**Features:**
- Custom CNN architecture
- Data preprocessing and augmentation
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy tracking and visualization
